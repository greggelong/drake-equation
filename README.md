### Random numbers for Drake
 
*(R), the average rate of star formations, in our galaxy is assumed to be 7 per year 
*(p), the percentage of formed stars that have planets 100% 1.0
*(n)for stars that have planets, the average number of planets that can potentially support life is, 6
*(l), the percentage of those planets that actually develop life, 94% 0.94
*(c), the percentage of these civilizations that have developed communications, i.e., technologies that release detectable signs into space,  24% 0.24
*(L), the length of time over which such civilizations release detectable signals,  598  years.
